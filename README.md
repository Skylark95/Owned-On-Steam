## Usage
Owned on Steam will automatically activate when looking at an individual game
on a supported store.  Upon activation, the game title will be search for in
your Steam library and Owned on Steam will take a ***"best guess"***\* effort
to determine if you own the game being displayed.

**Possible Results:**

![Owned](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skylark95/Owned-On-Steam/master/images/results/owned.png "Owned") - Match found in Steam Library

![Possibly Owned](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skylark95/Owned-On-Steam/master/images/results/possibly_owned.png "Possibly Owned") - A match was found using an "Aggressive Search" pattern.  Results may not be as accurate.

![Possibly Owned Multi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skylark95/Owned-On-Steam/master/images/results/possibly_owned_multi.png "Possibly Owned Multi") - Multiple matches were found using an "Aggressive Search" pattern.  Results may not be as accurate.

![Not Owned](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skylark95/Owned-On-Steam/master/images/results/not_owned.png "Not Owned") - Basic and Aggressive search did not find any matching game titles.

![Loading](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skylark95/Owned-On-Steam/master/images/results/loading.png "Loading") - Owned On Steam is loading ownership

![Error](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skylark95/Owned-On-Steam/master/images/results/error.png "Error") - An error occurred while loading ownership

cannot be guaranteed.  It is recommended you validate ownership of a game prior to purchase.
